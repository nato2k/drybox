# drybox
These scripts allow you to monitor the temperature and humidity in a set of dryboxes. This code allows you to monitor your dryboxes in a number of ways: 
* logs the readings to a database
* serve a website showing the readings in charts
* display the last readings on an LCD screen
* display color-coded LEDs based on the last readings

## Hardware Requirements
I use the following hardware for this project:
* Raspberry Pi 3B+
* Arduino Nano
* DHT22 sensors
* 20x4 I2C LCD module
* WS2812B LED strip with its own 5V power supply

## Instructions 
To be completed
