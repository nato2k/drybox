# drybox
These scripts allow you to monitor the temperature and humidity in a set of dryboxes. This code allows you to monitor your dryboxes in a number of ways: 
* logs the readings to a database
* serve a website showing the readings in charts
* display the last readings on an LCD screen
* display color-coded LEDs based on the last readings

## Hardware Requirements
I use the following hardware for this project:
* Raspberry Pi 3B+
* Arduino Nano
* DHT22 sensors
* 20x4 I2C LCD module
* WS2812B LED strip with its own 5V power supply
* 

## Software Used
* Raspbian Stretch Lite
* nginx web server
* PHP for the website
* MariaDB for the database
* Google Charts for interactive charts
* FastLED.io library to control LEDs
* Adafruit DHT library
* I2C LCD Driver by Denis Pleic
* Serial communication demo by user robin2 at http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=225329
